*Some visualizations that use Plotly might not appear. Therefore, I suggest manually downloading them if you wish to view the results.*  

1. The first step, i need to import and show how the data structured.    
   1.1 In this case i used `read_csv` and `info()`  
   1.2 Also check on the total of null values in columns, so i use `isnull().sum()`  
2. The step to is merge some column, but in this scenario i'm just merge for First Name and Last Name and then check it again using `info()`  
3. This third step is to make the datasets easier to read and using `drop()` function to eliminate unused columns  
4. Check the descriptive statistics with `describe()`  
5. After that we also can create some visualization, but at this scenario i'm show only few of them.
